# What is the Mobile Engage SDK?

Mobile Engage SDK is a tool that enables you to use Emarsys' Mobile Engage feature in a very straightforward way. By incorporating the SDK in your app, we support you, among others, in handling credentials, API calls, tracking of opens and events as well as logins and logouts in the app.

The Mobile Engage SDK is open sourced to enhance transparency and to do away with privacy concerns. You can always be up-to-date on what we are working on.

The preferred way of integrating the SDK can be found in the links below.
